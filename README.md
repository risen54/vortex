# Vortex

Whenever I start new project, I do the same thing...
1) make a folder with the name of the project inside my coding folder
2) create app.py or app.js etc
3) open an editor and write code....

### Why not automate this with python?

So I made this short project it just does the things mentioned above.
To use this as a cli app add the following line to code in your .bashrc, .zshrc or anything:

`alias vortex="python3 $HOME/vortex.py"

(note the path above, change it to wherever your file is)


And to make this work correctly, edit the paths inside the python file...

#### ENJOY!!
